            <h3><b>Introduction:</b></h3> <br>
            <h4>Consider a situation where we have a file shared between many people.</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>If one of the person tries editing the file, no other person should be reading or writing at the same
                    time, otherwise changes will not be visible to him/her.</li>
                <li>However, if some person is reading the file, then others may read it at the same time.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Problem parameters: that.</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>One set of data is shared among a number of processes.</li>
                <li>Once a writer is ready, it performs its write. Only one writer may write at a time.</li>
                <li>If a process is writing, no other process can read it.</li>
                <li>If at least one reader is reading, no other process can write.</li>
                <li>Readers may not write and only read.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Reader requests the entry to critical section.</li>
                <li>If allowed: 1. It increments the count of number of readers inside the critical section. If this reader is the first
                                    reader entering, it locks the wrt semaphore to restrict the entry of writers if any reader is inside.
                                2. It then, signals mutex as any other reader is allowed to enter while others are already reading.
                                3. After performing reading, it exits the critical section. When exiting, it checks if no more reader is
                                   inside, it signals the semaphore “wrt” as now, writer can enter the critical section.
                <li>If not allowed, it keeps on waiting.</li>
            </ul>

            // there is atleast one reader in the critical section

        <p class="conclusion">Thus, the semaphore 'wrt' is queued on both readers and writers in a manner such that preference is given to
            readers if writers are also there. Thus, no reader is waiting simply because a writer has requested to enter
            the
            critical section.</p>
